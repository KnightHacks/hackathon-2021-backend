            Welcome to KnightHacks, UCF's annual hackathon!
            <br>
            Now there's just one thing you must do
            <b> -- confirm your attendance.</b>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:160%;">
            In order to do so, simply check out the link below and submit the form.
            This will let us know that you will be attending and secure a spot for you!
            Your deadline to confirm is <b>{{deadline.strftime("%x @ %I:%M %p %Z")}}.</b>
            <br>
            If you don't confirm by the given date, your spot will not be guaranteed, 
            so please be sure to confirm right away!
        </p>

            <a href="{{href}}">Confirm here!</a>
            <br>
            We hope to see you at KnightHacks this year!
